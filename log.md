Hello world! My name is Zamir, I'm peruvian and I've worked as a lawyer the last 10 years. I decided to start my coding journey because I love this field and community, hoping it's not too late for me. <br/>
I'm happy to start with this challenge and I'll put good effort to achieve good learning after all. I know this will be tough and I'll wanna quit but I'm sure my Twitter friends and this log will keep me focused and motivated. Let's go!

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some lessons about Git.

**Thoughts:** I've recently started coding so I decided to learn about version control first of all. I have read about the importance of using Git in all kind of projects and I found a great free course from Udacity. Today I managed to figure out some basic functionality, like creating and cloning a repo, reviewing a repo's history, creating commits and tags.

**Today's Progress**: I've learnt about branching on Git.

**Thoughts** Branches are powerful! This is getting really complex but it's so exciting to see what you can do switching between branches in a project. It's like Marvel multiverse, lol. Teacher is great and I'm learning well, maybe tomorrow I'll finish the merging feature.

**Today's Progress**: I've learnt merging Git branches.

**Thoughts** Today I merged Git branches. It took me some time to understand this command because of merge conflicts but lecture was great (I repeated it at least twice). Btw, "git log --oneline --graph --all" blew my mind, is quite useful.
