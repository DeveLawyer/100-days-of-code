**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some lessons about Git.

**Thoughts:** I've recently started coding so I decided to learn about version control first of all. I have read about the importance of using Git in all kind of projects and I found a great free course from Udacity. Today I managed to figure out some basic functionality, like creating and cloning a repo, reviewing a repo's history, creating commits and tags.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
